# Kasino card game

This was my first programming project ever. I had just finished my first
programming course ever and making this as part of the next course was a huge
effort. Took me 75 hours, half it on the Java Swing GUI and half on features.

You can easily see it in the code that this was some of my first coding. I
thought that commenting everything, even the most obvious things, would lead
to salvation. I remember when I got feedback from the project that I was
surprised that you DON'T need to comment on everything, this made coding
easier and faster for me ever since so thanks for that feedback...

The structure of the classes is actually quite nice, but the code in them is
very crude. I seem to be very proud about the quality in the project
documentation, oh well, you live and you learn.

I am happy how this project turned out though, first GUI that I made, first AI
that I made and the AI is even competetive in this simple game of chance. I
recently tried playing against it and lost, wonderful feeling losing to
something you coded 14 years ago.

## Documentation

There is a lot of planning documentation and the project report, but I won't
include them here as they are pretty horrible. To summarize, I seem to have
written them half drunk making witty remarks about the code and complaining
how I don't have time to school because I have so much "other activities" at
the school. Sure, good idea to write that in the documentation...

## Running the code

Wonderful thing about Java and JVM is that even though I made that Kasino.jar
file 14 years ago I could just download it and double click it in Windows 10
and it just ran and worked.

So you can just run the .jar file on any platform that has JVM installed or
run the code manually. KasinoGUI is the main class.
